# Week 2 Challenge... To create a portfolio webpage from scratch!
## Description
* Our second weekly challenge where we were asked to create a webpage from scratch showcasing our projects, giving a brief "about me" section and ways to contact us. We were also asked to make our webpage accesible to more than just computer screens, but to tablets and mobile devices as well.
